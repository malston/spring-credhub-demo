= Spring CredHub Demo

This application can be used to test CredHub connectivity by deploying it to a Cloud Foundry platform that has CredHub installed. The demo application includes a deployment manifest that makes it simple to deploy the application. Use the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html[`cf` CLI] to target and authenticate to a Cloud Foundry platform, and run the following commands:

----
$ ../gradlew assemble
$ cf push -f manifest.yml
----

After deploying the application, send an HTTP request to the demo application with this command:

----
$ curl https://spring-credhub-demo.cf.example.com/credhub
----

The application will retrieve a set of credentials created by the `cf create-service` request, i.e.

```bash
cf create-service credhub default my-credhub-instance -c '{"name":"MY_CREDHUB_CRED","value":"ABCDEFGHIJK123456789"}
```
